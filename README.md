# RSA Public-Key Encryption Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of the RSA algorithm in C++.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

## Usage

To use the RSA algorithm, run the following command:

```bash
g++ rsa.cpp -o rsa
./rsa
```
For windows, you have directly the executable file.
Note that the executable file may need re-compilation.
